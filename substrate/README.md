# Substrate

## Terminology

- **Relay chain**: The Polkadot super chain which is connected to different parachains.
- **Parachain**: The side-chains which are connected to the main Polkadot relay chain.
- **Collator**: Validator for Polkadot parachain
- **Substrate runtime**: It's like `wasm`, `bytecode` for other blockchain networks.

## Comparo with EVM

| EVM Stack                          |

## Why Rust

- Able to write safe code, at compile-time (done using `$ cargo check`), rather than run-time failures in C++
- Fast
- High level compared to C++

> NOTE: Any language can be chosen for Substrate. Parity, Web3 foundation is inclined towards Rust.

## Architecture

Substrate is modular & extensive. Each module is called "Pallet".
