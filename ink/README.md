## About

- Substrate's Contract Pallet (out of all library of pallets) allows Substrate-based chains to run SC on top of it.
- SC language: A eDSL based `rust` language
- SC binary: `wasm` format
- Testnet (local): Kickstart your own substrate parachain with [substrate-contracts-node](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node) & to view on block explorer:
- Testnet (public):
  - Rococo (Relay chain)
    - Canvas (parachain) supporting `ink!` SC. It is substrate-based.
- Mainnet (Relay chain)
  - Polkadot
  - Kusama (for canary release): The newer features are first integrated here & then launched on Polkadot as stable version like LTS vs Latest in NodeJS.
    > Unlike other blockchains, where there are 1 mainnet, here there are 2 relay chains. They did this to ensure test happening on Kusama with real tokens, not with the faucet ones.

## Installation

> Below guide is for macOS (M1)

### 1. Cargo, Rust

- Follow this [guide](https://github.com/abhi3700/My_Learning-Rust/blob/main/README.md#installation)

### 2. Linting, Compiler

1. `$ rustup component add rust-src` (add rust standard library)
2. `$ cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link` [lint `ink!` code]
3. `$ cargo install cargo-contract --force --locked` [**install**/**update** compiler]
   > 1, 2, is for `cargo-contract` to work with `cargo-dylint` & `dylint-link` respectively.

**Verify installation**

```console
‚ùØ cargo-contract --version
cargo-contract 1.5.0-unknown-aarch64-apple-darwin
```

### 3. Substrate Framework Pre-requisites

1. `$ rustup toolchain install nightly`
2. `$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly`

### 4. The Substrate SC Node

**Install**/**Update** the substrate node from source code:

`$ cargo install contracts-node --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node.git --force --locked`

#### probable issues

- Error: missing protobuf
  - _solution_: `brew install protobuf`
