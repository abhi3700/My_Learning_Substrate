## Overview

- Like a DAO pallet.
- Pallet dependencies:
  - Scheduler pallet

As soon as the Enactment delay ends, the proposal is sent to the "Scheduler Pallet" deploy the code to the runtime.

On Kusama, the voting period is 8 days & on Polkadot, it is 28 days.

Here, if someone locks token for 28 days, they will get 1 as vote multiplier. If they lock for 56 days, they will get 2 as vote multiplier. This is called conviction voting. We can also delegate voting power to someone else. Still the vote multiplier is applicable.

**Conviction Voting**: This is a mechanism that allows a token holder to lock their tokens for an extended period of time to gain a multiplier to the strength of their vote. The longer they are willing to lock their tokens, the stronger their vote is going to be. This also applies when delegating votes to another person.

**Adaptive Quorum Biasing**: This is a mechanism used to combat low voter turnout in on-chain governance. It helps to pass proposals when there's low turnout but a high degree of certainty that the proposal is needed. In positive turnout bias, if 25% of the total token holders participate, 66% agreement is needed for a proposal to pass. In negative turnout bias, only one-third agreement is needed. However, as participation moves towards 100%, it becomes closer to a simple majority. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgcUWK2E9Jo&list=PLOyWqupZ-WGsfnlpkk0KWX3uS4yg6ZztG&index=26&t=671s)

#### Demo

Watch from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgcUWK2E9Jo&list=PLOyWqupZ-WGsfnlpkk0KWX3uS4yg6ZztG&index=26&t=1216s)

1. Create a preimage hash for the proposal. E.g. "Create a balance of 1 Unit for Dave"...Use `Balances` pallet, `transfer` function to transfer 1 Unit to Dave. Then, use `hash` function to create a preimage hash. E.g. "0x0a0b0c0d0e0f" (autogenerated in PolkadotJS UI App).
2. Create a proposal with the preimage hash. The proposal is shown with details of token transfer.
3. Endorse your proposal (some amount is locked for the lifetime of the proposal).
4. Now, wait for the votes to be casted. The votes are shown in the UI during the voting period.
5. If there is no Council, then after passing a default enactment period, it automatically gets enacted. Here, for scheduling, `Scheduler` pallet is used.

Governance 2.0 would have more throughput. Currently, we have only 28 days. That means only 12 proposals a year as 1 proposal per block rule set.

### Coding

<!--
TODO:

- Structure of the pallet.

  ```
  [Democracy mod]

      |__ [Storage]
      |__ [Hooks]
      |__ [Impl Pallet with extrinsics]
